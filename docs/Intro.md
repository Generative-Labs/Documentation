# Intro

Web3MQ is a **decentralized secure communication protocol** dedicated to becoming crypto-native communication infrastructure. We reconnect isolated social platforms with a unified inbox, enabling information to be freely generated, flowed and communicated across terminals. We support end-to-end encrypted communication with distributed storage, ensuring that no third party can access users' chat messages and that users have full ownership of their data.

Web3MQ's **push, chat and community** features provide an all-in-one solution for communication. Also, Web3MQ is compatible with a wide range of **social identities and social graph protocols**, using communication protocols as a bridge to unlock the potential of each social relationship. We will also introduce the existing Web3 ecology, including web3 storage (e.g. IPFS) and computing (e.g. Internet Computer), to complement our messaging ecology. Users can achieve higher levels of privacy protection and other personalized features through custom configurations.

Web3MQ will ultimately be driven, refined and updated by the community, and every developer’s input will have an impact. Web3MQ will always uphold the open and inclusive spirit of open source, unite efforts in the cause of Web3 communication, and help everyone build the next brighter era of information communication.

## **ID-to-ID Chat**

Cross-platform&Cross-chain: Use 1 Web3MQ UserID to communicate with users from any chain on any platform.

## **Actionable Social Connection**

Web3MQ is compatible with a wide range of social identities and social graph protocols, unlocking the potential of every social relationship in dynamic communication, from static presentation to dynamic conversation, generating real value in the social connections.

## **Real-Time Notifications**

Provide true real-time notifications via "Push”, ensuring important information reaches every real user.

## **Open Network**

Our protocol is an open network that allows users to deploy and host their own nodes.

## **Open-Source and Community-Driven**

The foundation of Web3mq's long-term growth is the community. Web3mq will be developed, built, and collectively decided by incorporating the individual developer opinions.
